abstract = {Performance improvement is the main goal of the study of PID control and much research has been conducted for this purpose. The PID filter is implemented in almost all industrial processes because of its well-known beneficial features. In general, the whole system's performance strongly depends on the controller's efficiency and hence the tuning process plays a key role in the system's behaviour. In this work, the servo systems will be analysed, specifically the positioning control systems. Among the existent tuning methods, the Gain-Phase Margin method based on Frequency Response analysis is the most adequate for controller tuning in positioning control systems. Nevertheless, this method can be improved by integrating an optimization technique. The novelty of this work is the development of a new methodology for PID control tuning by coupling the Gain-Phase Margin method with the Genetic Algorithms in which the micro-population concept and adaptive mutation probability are applied. Simulations using a positioning system model in MATLAB and experimental tests in two CNC machines and an industrial robot are carried out in order to show the effectiveness of the proposal. The obtained results are compared with both the classical Gain-Phase Margin tuning and with a recent PID controller optimization using Genetic Algorithms based on real codification. The three methodologies are implemented using software.},

abstract = {A number of air traffic management decision support tools (DST) are being developed to help air traffic managers and controllers improve capacity, efficiency, and safety in the National Airspace System. Although DST functionality may vary widely, trajectory prediction algorithms can be found at the core of most DST. A methodology is presented for the automated statistical analysis of trajectory prediction accuracy as a function of phase of flight (level-flight, climb, descent) and look-ahead time. The methodology is focused on improving trajectory prediction algorithm performance for DST applications such as conflict detection and arrival metering. The methodology has been implemented in software and tested with air traffic data. Aggregate trajectory prediction accuracy statistics are computed and displayed in histogram format based on 2,774 large commercial jet flights from five different days of Fort Worth Center air traffic data. The results show that trajectory prediction anomalies can be detected by examining error distributions for large numbers of trajectory predictions. The ability of the trajectory analysis methodology to detect the effects of subsequent changes to the trajectory prediction algorithm and to aircraft performance model parameters was also demonstrated.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for traffic situation awareness and alerting using ADS-B. The objective of the system is to alert pilots of incoming potential collisions or hazardous situations. The system, intended for all aircraft types, particularly targets General Aviation aircraft, as it should demonstrate high performance such as an early detection time and a low nuisance alert rate, in dense traffic conditions such as airport traffic patterns. The algorithm takes a deterministic approach to the collision avoidance problem. We define two buffer zones surrounding the target, or intruder, aircraft. The first, the Collision Airspace Zone (CAZ), has a constant size, which is based on uncertainties in position measurement for the ownship and the intruder. The second, the Protected Airspace Zone, is dynamic and is intended to reflect the distance pilots feel comfortable flying from other aircraft based on closure rate. We define two levels of alert based on the prediction of the buffer zones. A high level alert, based on CAZ penetration, indicates the potential of a mid-air collision. A medium level alert, based on PAZ penetration, warns the pilot that his aircraft may come in close proximity to another aircraft. Trajectory prediction is based on propagating constant turn rate, velocity and vertical velocity for both the target and ownship. Using an encounter model to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on representative traffic, we show that the trajectory propagation method outperforms the linear velocity propagation currently used by TCAS.},

To guarantee surveillance integrity, it is clear that performance assessments of the different elements of the surveillance system are necessary. Due to the evolution suffered by the surveillance processing chain in the recent past, its complexity has been increased by the integration of new sensor types (e.g., automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast [ADS-B] [1], Mode S radars [2], and wide area multilateration [WAM] [3]), data link applications, and networking technologies.

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of short to mid-term aircraft trajectory prediction, that is, the estimation of where an aircraft will be located over a 10-30. min time horizon. Such a problem is central in decision support tools, especially in conflict detection and resolution algorithms. It also appears when an air traffic controller observes traffic on the radar screen and tries to identify convergent aircraft, which may be in conflict in the near future. An innovative approach for aircraft trajectory prediction is presented in this paper. This approach is based on local linear functional regression that considers data preprocessing, localizing and solving linear regression using wavelet decomposition. This algorithm takes into account only past radar tracks, and does not use any physical or aeronautical parameters. This approach has been successfully applied to aircraft trajectories between several airports on the data set that is one year air traffic over France. The method is intrinsic and independent from airspace structure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The effectiveness and reliability of air traffic Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD{\&}R) is greatly affected by the uncertainty in the future position of the aircraft. On the Eurocontrol-led ERASMUS1 program, we have conducted a study of the accuracy and sensitivity to disturbances of airborne Trajectory Predictions (TP). As future ATM concepts are typically based on information sharing between the air and ground, our analysis is focused on the factors that can be potentially improved by air-ground communication. For instance, ground systems may have access to the most up to date weather forecasts from the NOAA/NWS, yet have little information about the aircraft state and intent or local atmospheric conditions. Aircraft have accurate measurements of the local wind and temperature during the flight but have limited access to the latest weather forecasts. This paper analyzes the sources of errors that impact the TP performance, and the accuracy of the FMS predicted trajectory when compared against the flown trajectory. We also discuss the suitable metrics for this analysis and the potential use of shared intent data as a way to improve the ground based TP.},

Under this paradigm, an aircraft trajectory can be expressed at different levels of detail using a set of novel intent-related formal languages. These languages can be used for describing different aspects of aircraft motion or the resulting predicted trajectory, ranging from high-level restrictions imposed on the trajectory to details on how the aircraft will be operated at any specific instant. After defining the complete hierarchy of these formal languages, the concept of trajectory language processing engine is introduced. Every engine can perform automated modifications over a trajectory specified at different levels or at the same level considering the language hierarchy. Finally, several engine examples are described, and a complete trajectory computation process is built as an engine composed through the smart interconnection of several engines. Examples of executions of these automated processes are also included.},

abstract = {In this paper, a formal language called the aircraft intent description language (AIDL) is proposed as a standard, interoperable means of describing and exchanging predicted aircraft trajectories in trajectory-based operations (TBO). The AIDL provides the necessary elements to unambiguously formulate aircraft intent, which, in the context of trajectory prediction, refers to the information that describes how the aircraft is to be operated within a certain time interval. By expressing aircraft intent according to the AIDL, it is ensured that each instance of aircraft intent defines a unique trajectory. It is anticipated that sharing aircraft intent information expressed in a structured and formal manner, e.g. according to the AIDL, can facilitate the synchronization of the predicted aircraft trajectories held by different automation systems in the context of TBO. The AIDL is characterized by an alphabet and a grammar. The definition of the alphabet and the grammar rules are based on a rigorous mathematical analysis of the trajectory computation process at the core of a TP. This analysis relies on a novel approach to modeling the trajectory computation process based on the theory of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). The paper presents the alphabet of the AIDL, which contains a set of instructions that capture the individual commands and guidance modes available to direct the motion of an aircraft in the ATM context. Then, the AIDL grammar rules, which define the possible combinations of the instructions in the alphabet, are defined and mathematically justified. The AIDL seeks to exploit the physical and mathematical foundations underlying the trajectory computation process to allow describing a priori (i.e. before a trajectory is actually computed) any possible motion behavior that can reasonably be elicited from an aircraft in the ATM context. The objective is that the AIDL encompasses all other methods and formats that may be used to describe aircraft intent,- i.e. they would be subsets of the AIDL. The AIDL could thus be seen as a metalanguage for aircraft intent description, containing any other language that may be used to describe aircraft intent in the context of TBO.},

Integral action is used to compensate for the effects of the unknown load-torque, and adaptation is employed to estimate the unknown parameters. In the case that parameters are known (except for the load), we show that the origin of the closed-loop system is uniformly globally expo- nentially stable. For the case of unknown parameters, we prove uniform global asymptotic stability; hence, we establish parametric convergence. In contrast to other adaptive control schemes for electrical machines, we use a reduced-order adaptive controller. Indeed, adaptation is used only for the electrical dynamics equa- tions. Moreover, not surprisingly, the closed-loop system has a structure well-studied in adaptive-control literature. Performance is illustrated in a numerical setting.},
