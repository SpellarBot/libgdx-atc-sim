Worklog
==============

[/management/Worklog.csv](../../../management/Worklog.csv) will act as our work load tracker. I've used the template we decided in the meeting, but split the Date into Day,Month so that we can filter more precisely if required.

The document will instinctively open in Excel, but using Notepad/Sublime/etc,  you will see it is quite simple and uses the following format:


	Day,Month,Team Member,Work Time,Task ID,"Description"


You just need to follow the headings, put a comma between each attribute, and we're good to go!

```eval_rst
.. important:: Please ensure that you surround your description with quotation marks.
```
